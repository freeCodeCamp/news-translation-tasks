# Welcome to our Article Translation Workflow

## Hey there, awesome community!

Excited to have you on board for our localization mission! Here's a simple guide to get you started:

Please sign up through [this form](https://forms.gle/1w8umSbTF4JTPwyj9) if you have not already done so. This will enable us to send you an invitation to join the "news-translation-tasks" as a Collaborator. 

**Can't wait to have you officially join the team!**

### Pick Your Article

Once you're in as a Collaborator, it's time to choose which article you'd like to work on. Check out the list of available issues/articles and pick the one that speaks to you from the Project of the spoken language you would like to help on.

### Claim Your Article

Found the perfect piece to translate? Awesome! Just comment `/translate` on the issue. This will automatically assign the issue to you and move the card to the "in Translation" status.

*It may take a few minutes before the GitHub Actions workflow responds to the command. When it's done, it will add a comment "@username We have assigned this article to you."

### Ready for Review

After you've translated your piece, give us a heads up by commenting `/review`. This will automatically move the card to the "in Revision" and let our Language Leads or Proofreaders know that it's time to revise your translation and prepare before potentially publishing it.

Easy peasy, right? We're stoked to have your help in bringing these articles and handbooks to new audiences around the world. 

**Let's get translating!**
