Rishab grew up in India and moved to Canada for school. But he couldn't afford to finish. He resorted to delivering pizzas and working at a gas station. But he worked hard to teach himself how to code and how to build cloud infrastructure, and eventually got a job Google.

We talk about:

-   How to teach yourself cloud engineering
    
-   Getting repeatedly rejected from FAANG jobs but persisting
    
-   Filling up the Infinity Gauntlet with cloud certifications
    
-   How DevOps and Cloud Engineering are changing
