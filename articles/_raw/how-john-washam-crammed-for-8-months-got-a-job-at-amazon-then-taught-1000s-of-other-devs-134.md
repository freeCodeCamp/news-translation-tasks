On this week's episode of the podcast, I interview John Washam, a software engineer at Amazon. John's also creator of one of the most popular open source projects of all time, Coding Interview University.

This is John's first-ever podcast interview, and the first time he's told his story. Interviewing him was an absolute honor.

We talk about:

-   How John delivered pizzas to save enough money to buy his first computer in the 90s. "I was tired of being a broke kid."
    
-   John's first career in the US military, where he worked as a translator in South Korea
    
-   How John crammed Computer Science for 8 months and taught himself enough theory and coding skills to get a job in big tech, then published Coding Interview University on GitHub
    
-   What it's like to work as a senior developer at a big tech company, and what you can expect the journey to be like
    

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1986 rock song.
